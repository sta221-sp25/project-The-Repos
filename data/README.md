# Data

We are sourcing our data from a project created by Prof. Fadi Fayez Thabtah of the Manukau Institute of Technology in New Zealand, who collected the [data](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/426/autism+screening+adult) from voluntary participants of his app, ASDTests, which screens its users for potential indicators of autism using a [10-question survey](https://embrace-autism.com/aq-10/).
